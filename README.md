Pytorch implement of Arxiv paper: [Neural Network Renormalization Group][https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02840].

**NeuralRG** is a deep generative model using variational renormalization group approach, it is composed by layers of bijectors(In our demo, we use [realNVP][https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803]). After training, it can directly generate statistically independent physical configurations.
